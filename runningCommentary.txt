1. You asked for simple checkout functionality, and hinted that real input from a customer was required.

So I give you the capability of producing a price given a list of strings, presumably harvested off standard input dutifully typed in by the checkout operator on an old 70's teletype.

Rather than speculate on the nature of the IO system, let's focus on what we can test - take some strings and output a price.

You fixed the items and prices and this is going to be written in a short iteration - so no need to worry about configuration.

I would suggest the following tests:-

i) no items purchased means no bill.

ii) one item purchased means the customer pays the price of that item.

iii) if I purchase N items (could be the same ones repeated, maybe all in a bunch, maybe not), then the customer pays the sum of the bill for the first N-1 plus the price of the Nth item.

iv) As a sanity check, a customer would expect that regardless of how they give the items to the checkout person, they get the same bill in all circumstances.

v) WON'T DO - suppose an item was entered when it shouldn't have by the checkout person (or the customer changed their mind). Should there be a may of cancelling the last item, or the last apple or orange?
